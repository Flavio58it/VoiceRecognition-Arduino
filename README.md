<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
   Voice-biometrics refers to the technology or process of speech processing where voice can be used to verify a personal identity, unobtrusively and invisibly. Like other speechprocessing tools, voice biometrics extract information from the stream of speech to accomplish their work. In our model we are focusing on its ability to recognize what is being said. Voice recognition is a biometric modality that uses an individual’s voice for recognition purposes. Our proposed model or program receives and interprets dictation as well as understands and carries out the spoken command. Voice biometric solutions eliminate the need for PIN based password or interrogation–based authentication methods, or can be used to add another level of security to those systems.

  The <b>Arduino Uno R3</b> is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip <b>ATmega328P</b> microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits.
  </p>
  <p>
 Our model uses this board to control the analog signals passed from the mobile app, named <b>Android Meets Robot</b> to the Arduino via the <b>HC05 Bluetooth module</b>. It is programmed as per the need to fulfill the requirements of a Voice Recognition System fitted in smart homes.</p>
 <p>
We have currently implemented a simpler version of the Home Security System using Voice Recognition and we are aiming to develop it further using Machine Learning to implement only selected users’ voices to be accepted; right now, anyone with the correct “key phrase” can unlock or lock the device.
